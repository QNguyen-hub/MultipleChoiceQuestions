This is my challenge to write a mutliple choice questions.

There were a lot of challenges for me with this assignment.

First road block was trying to get the text to appear from an array that had objects with keys.

Second was getting the questions to move on to the next if it was correct.

I had some code that I reference for idea from classmates and youtube specifically "Web Dev Simplified".

I was able to work and get the code to start going.

The problem I am stuck on is getting the old questions to disappear before the next one appears.

I am submitting this for now and will continue to work on it was I go through this bootcamp and learn new concept.
